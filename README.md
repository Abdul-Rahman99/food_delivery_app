App Name: Flutter Food Delivery

# Description:
The Flutter Food Delivery app combines the best features of Uber and Talabat to create a platform that allows customers to request healthy, natural food from home chefs. With the convenience of Uber and the culinary expertise of Talabat, users can enjoy delicious homemade meals delivered right to their doorstep.

# Features:

Customer Requests: Customers can browse through a variety of home chefs and their available menus. They can place orders for their desired meals, specifying any dietary preferences or special instructions.

Home Chefs: Talented home chefs can create profiles on the app, showcasing their culinary skills and menu offerings. They have the flexibility to set their availability and update their menus regularly.

Order and Delivery Tracking: Customers can track the status of their orders, from the moment they are placed until they are delivered. Real-time updates provide transparency and ensure a seamless delivery experience.

Proximity-based Requests: To avoid delays in food delivery, the app ensures that customer requests are limited to home chefs within a 1-kilometer radius. This ensures that the food is prepared and delivered promptly.

Ratings and Reviews: After receiving their orders, customers can rate and provide feedback on the home chefs. This feature helps maintain a high standard of quality and provides valuable insights to both customers and chefs.

Payment Integration: The app offers secure payment options, allowing customers to pay for their orders within the app. Multiple payment methods, such as credit cards or digital wallets, can be integrated for a seamless checkout experience.
